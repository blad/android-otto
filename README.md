## Graphics & Icons

### The Noun Project

[The Noun Project](http://www.thenounproject.com) is the source for some the graphics used in this application. The following users' work was used:

- [Dice](http://thenounproject.com/term/dice/20125/) created by [Derek Palladino](http://thenounproject.com/derekjp/)
- [Cloud-Upload](http://thenounproject.com/term/cloud-upload/9947/) created by [Scott Lewis](http://thenounproject.com/iconify/)
- [Magnifying-Glass](http://thenounproject.com/term/magnifying-glass/89626/) public domain icon

The noun project is a great resource for finding clip art for use in applications.

### Android Asset Studio

Icon generator that allows you to quickly and easily generate icons from existing source images, clipart, or text. You can generate Launcher icons, Action bar and tab icons,  Notification icons and Generic icons. The asset studio allows you to adjust sizing, padding, and tint icons.

### Material Palette

Material Pallet is a simple web app that allows you to generate a color
pallet and export the corresponding xml. This allows non-designers to pick a pallet
that makes sense visually, and aligns with the guidelines for Material Design.

Additionally this helps enforce the correct use of color names in Android themes.
